371. Sum of Two Integers

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1

//0ms. Be carefull that a negative value can not left shift.
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    long long carry;
    while(b!=0){
        carry = a&b;
        a = a^b;
        b = (carry&0xFFFFFFFF)<<1;      //it makes b never be a negative value. Without it, getSum(-1, 1) cause an error.
    }
    return a;
}

//another solution
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : getSum(a ^ b, (a & b & 0x7fffffff) << 1);
